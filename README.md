# PhysioDrum ü•Åü•Ω
The Internet of Multisensory, Multimedia, and Musical Things (Io3MT) bridges computer science, humanities, and arts, fostering transmedia services and creative applications. This demo research applies these principles alongside extended reality (XR) to enhance PhysioDrum, an immersive, multimodal system that blends physical and digital aspects to expand musical expression in virtual environments. Using a smart musical instrument (SMI) and electronic pedals as interfaces, users interact with a virtual drum kit through gestures while receiving haptic feedback. By integrating sound and multimedia elements, PhysioDrum aims to reduces cognitive load and the learning curve, merging traditional drumming practices with immersive XR. The demo emphasizes design strategies that enhance playability, accessibility, and creative potential for users of all skill levels.
